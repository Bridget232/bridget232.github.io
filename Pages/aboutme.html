        In 2020, my life changed. I lost my job due to the Covid pandemic. With extra time on my hands, I spent more time online. While online, I saw an ad for a course on how to learn to code. I had previously never heard of coding before. I decided to check it out. I instantly fell in love with coding and decided to teach myself to code. I started with HTML, CSS, and Python. Then I thought “what if I went back to school for computer science?” I applied to a scholarship and won. In 2022, I went back to school for a bachelor’s degree in computer science at Kent State, where I am currently attending. My projected graduation date is 2026. I look forward to embarking on my next adventure as a software developer.
